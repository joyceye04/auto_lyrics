Please sit down by my side
I wanna be your friend
I will write a song for you
A simple song like this

Emm……

I’m trying to make you stay
I feel things will be alright
Before you leave me alone
I wanna sing a song

Emm……

Everytime the sun rises
I will remember you
I know it’s you
I won’t forget you

Emm……
